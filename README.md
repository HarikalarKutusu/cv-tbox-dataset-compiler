# Common Voice Dataset Compiler - Common Voice ToolBox

This repository contains a python commmand line utility for offline pre-calculating the data for Common Voice Dataset Analyzer, which is actually a viewer.
To be able to use this, you have to download the datasets yourselves and provide the tsv files and other data (such as clip durations and text-corpora).
It is a lengthy process using huge amounts of data and you are not expected to use this utility. We already use it, and you can view the results in the Common Voice Dataset Analyzer.
This code is provided as part of being open-source.
